# VBA-challenge

I have uploaded the following files for grading:
- VBA script
- Screenshots of results for different years (2018, 2019, 2020)
- Excel Macro-Enabled file I used for testing

I tried uploading the Multi_year_data_Stock file but it is too large.
Note that the script for the testing file and the Multi_year_data_Stock file
is the same with the only difference beign that some variables were defined
as "Integer" in the test file and as "Long" in the Multi_year_data_Stock file
